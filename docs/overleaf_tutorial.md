## Writing your first piece of LaTeX

The first step is to create a new LaTeX project. You can do this on your own computer by creating a new `.tex` file; alternatively, you can [start a new project in Overleaf](https://cn.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Creating_a_document_in_Overleaf "Creating a document in Overleaf").

Let’s start with the simplest working example, which can be opened directly in Overleaf:

\documentclass{article}
\begin{document}
First document. This is a simple example, with no 
extra parameters or packages included.
\end{document}

 [Open this example in Overleaf.](https://www.overleaf.com/docs?engine=pdflatex&snip_name=Simplest+working+example+LaTeX+document&snip=%5Cdocumentclass%7Barticle%7D%0A%5Cbegin%7Bdocument%7D%0AFirst+document.+This+is+a+simple+example%2C+with+no+%0Aextra+parameters+or+packages+included.%0A%5Cend%7Bdocument%7D)

This example produces the following output:

![Example document](https://images.ctfassets.net/nrgyaltdicpt/5oBbZABsWEnHZpwhfvV2PD/95ba7d5496616b4f10dffe6fb90f578a/LL30Fig1-plain.svg)

You can see that LaTeX has automatically indented the first line of the paragraph, taking care of that formatting for you. Let’s have a closer look at what each part of our code does.

The first line of code, `\documentclass{article}`, declares the document type known as its _class_, which controls the overall appearance of the document. Different types of documents require different classes; i.e., a CV/resume will require a different class than a scientific paper which might use the standard LaTeX `article` class. Other types of documents you may be working on may require different classes such as `book` or `report`. To get some idea of the many LaTeX class types available, [visit the relevant page on CTAN (Comprehensive TeX Archive Network)](https://www.ctan.org/topic/class).

Having set the document class, our content, known as the _body_ of the document, is written between the `\begin{document}` and `\end{document}` tags. After opening the example above, you can make changes to the text and, when finished, view the resulting typeset PDF by _recompiling the document_. To do this in Overleaf, simply hit **Recompile**, as demonstrated in this brief video clip:

Any Overleaf project can be configured to recompile automatically each time it is edited: click the small arrow next to the **Recompile** button and set **Auto Compile** to **On**, as shown in the following screengrab:

![Screengrab showing how to set Auto Compile to On or Off](https://sharelatex-wiki-cdn-671420.c.cdn77.org/learn-scripts/images/7/77/LL30autocompile.png)

Having seen how to add content to our document, the next step is to give it a title. To do this, we must talk briefly about the **preamble**.

## The preamble of a document

The screengrab above shows Overleaf storing a LaTeX document as a file called `main.tex`: the `.tex` file extension is, by convention, used when naming files containing your document’s LaTeX code.

The previous example showed how document content was entered after the `\begin{document}` command; however, everything in your `.tex` file appearing _before_ that point is called the _preamble_, which acts as the document’s “setup” section. Within the preamble you define the document class (type) together with specifics such as languages to be used when writing the document; loading _packages_ you would like to use (more on this [later](https://cn.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Learn_LaTeX_in_30_minutes#Finding_and_using_LaTeX_packages)), and it is where you’d apply other types of configuration.

A minimal document preamble might look like this:

\documentclass[12pt, letterpaper]{article}
\usepackage{graphicx}

where `\documentclass[12pt, letterpaper]{article}` defines the overall class (type) of document. Additional parameters, which must be separated by commas, are included in square brackets (`[...]`) and used to configure this instance of the article class; i.e., settings we wish to use for this particular `article`-class-based document.

In this example, the two parameters do the following:

- `12pt` sets the font size
- `letterpaper` sets the paper size

Of course other font sizes, `9pt`, `11pt`, `12pt`, can be used, but if none is specified, the default size is `10pt`. As for the paper size, other possible values are `a4paper` and `legalpaper`. For further information see the article about [page size and margins](https://cn.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Page_size_and_margins "Page size and margins").

The preamble line

\usepackage{graphicx}

is an example of loading an external package (here, [`graphicx`](https://ctan.org/pkg/graphicx?lang=en)) to extend LaTeX’s capabilities, enabling it to import external graphics files. LaTeX packages are discussed in the section [Finding and using LaTeX packages](https://cn.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Learn_LaTeX_in_30_minutes#Finding_and_using_LaTeX_packages).

## Including title, author and date information

Adding a title, author and date to our document requires three more lines in the _preamble_ (_not_ the main body of the document). Those lines are:

- `\title{My first LaTeX document}`: the document title
- `\author{Hubert Farnsworth}`: here you write the name of the author(s) and, optionally, the `\thanks` command within the curly braces:
    - `\thanks{Funded by the Overleaf team.}`: can be added after the name of the author, inside the braces of the `author` command. It will add a superscript and a footnote with the text inside the braces. Useful if you need to thank an institution in your article.
- `\date{August 2022}`: you can enter the date manually or use the command `\today` to typeset the current date every time the document is compiled

With these lines added, your preamble should look something like this:

\documentclass[12pt, letterpaper]{article}
\title{My first LaTeX document}
\author{Hubert Farnsworth\thanks{Funded by the Overleaf team.}}
\date{August 2022}

To typeset the title, author and date use the `\maketitle` command within the _body_ of the document:

\begin{document}
\maketitle
We have now added a title, author and date to our first \LaTeX{} document!
\end{document}

The preamble and body can now be combined to produce a complete document which can be opened in Overleaf:

\documentclass[12pt, letterpaper]{article}
\title{My first LaTeX document}
\author{Hubert Farnsworth\thanks{Funded by the Overleaf team.}}
\date{August 2022}
\begin{document}
\maketitle
We have now added a title, author and date to our first \LaTeX{} document!
\end{document}

 [Open this example in Overleaf.](https://www.overleaf.com/docs?engine=pdflatex&snip_name=My+first+LaTeX+document&snip=%5Cdocumentclass%5B12pt%2C+letterpaper%5D%7Barticle%7D%0A%5Ctitle%7BMy+first+LaTeX+document%7D%0A%5Cauthor%7BHubert+Farnsworth%5Cthanks%7BFunded+by+the+Overleaf+team.%7D%7D%0A%5Cdate%7BAugust+2022%7D%0A%5Cbegin%7Bdocument%7D%0A%5Cmaketitle%0AWe+have+now+added+a+title%2C+author+and+date+to+our+first+%5CLaTeX%7B%7D+document%21%0A%5Cend%7Bdocument%7D)

This example produces the following output:

![Image of a simple document produced in LaTeX](https://images.ctfassets.net/nrgyaltdicpt/3WzMd0bx2zlj3zLTKS8SxT/dc2b7c16adbc96bdd750b6d2c8b4227e/LL30Fig2r-plain.svg)

## Adding comments

LaTeX is a form of “program code”, but one which specializes in document typesetting; consequently, as with code written in any other programming language, it can be very useful to include comments within your document. A LaTeX comment is a section of text that will not be typeset or affect the document in any way—often used to add “to do” notes; include explanatory notes; provide in-line explanations of tricky macros or comment-out lines/sections of LaTeX code when debugging.

To make a comment in LaTeX, simply write a `%` symbol at the beginning of the line, as shown in the following code which uses the example above:

\documentclass[12pt, letterpaper]{article}
\title{My first LaTeX document}
\author{Hubert Farnsworth\thanks{Funded by the Overleaf team.}}
\date{August 2022}
\begin{document}
\maketitle
We have now added a title, author and date to our first \LaTeX{} document!

% This line here is a comment. It will not be typeset in the document.
\end{document}

 [Open this example in Overleaf.](https://www.overleaf.com/docs?engine=pdflatex&snip_name=My+first+LaTeX+document+with+a+comment&snip=%5Cdocumentclass%5B12pt%2C+letterpaper%5D%7Barticle%7D%0A%5Ctitle%7BMy+first+LaTeX+document%7D%0A%5Cauthor%7BHubert+Farnsworth%5Cthanks%7BFunded+by+the+Overleaf+team.%7D%7D%0A%5Cdate%7BAugust+2022%7D%0A%5Cbegin%7Bdocument%7D%0A%5Cmaketitle%0AWe+have+now+added+a+title%2C+author+and+date+to+our+first+%5CLaTeX%7B%7D+document%21%0A%0A%25+This+line+here+is+a+comment.+It+will+not+be+typeset+in+the+document.%0A%5Cend%7Bdocument%7D)

This example produces output that is identical to the previous LaTeX code which did not contain the comment.

## Bold, italics and underlining

Next, we will now look at some text formatting commands:

- **Bold**: bold text in LaTeX is typeset using the `\textbf{...}` command.
- _Italics_: italicised text is produced using the `\textit{...}` command.
- Underline: to underline text use the `\underline{...}` command.

The next example demonstrates these commands:

Some of the \textbf{greatest}
discoveries in \underline{science} 
were made by \textbf{\textit{accident}}.

 [Open this example in Overleaf.](https://www.overleaf.com/docs?engine=pdflatex&snip_name=First+example+with+formatted+text&snip=%5Cdocumentclass%5B12pt%2C+letterpaper%5D%7Barticle%7D%0A%5Ctitle%7BMy+first+LaTeX+document%7D%0A%5Cauthor%7BHubert+Farnsworth%5Cthanks%7BFunded+by+the+Overleaf+team.%7D%7D%0A%5Cdate%7BAugust+2022%7D%0A%5Cbegin%7Bdocument%7D%0A%5Cmaketitle%0ASome+of+the+%5Ctextbf%7Bgreatest%7D%0Adiscoveries+in+%5Cunderline%7Bscience%7D+%0Awere+made+by+%5Ctextbf%7B%5Ctextit%7Baccident%7D%7D.%0A%5Cend%7Bdocument%7D)

This example produces the following output:

![Imate showing text formatted in a LaTeX document](https://images.ctfassets.net/nrgyaltdicpt/6vo15r0tLCByTpcvn1w2E8/8f14edc7ece1f10ce4ba2c76e1e58a56/LL30Fig3r-plain.svg)

Another very useful command is `\emph{_argument_}`, whose effect on its `_argument_` depends on the context. Inside normal text, the emphasized text is italicized, but this behaviour is reversed if used inside an italicized text—see the next example:

Some of the greatest \emph{discoveries} in science 
were made by accident.

\textit{Some of the greatest \emph{discoveries} 
in science were made by accident.}

\textbf{Some of the greatest \emph{discoveries} 
in science were made by accident.}

 [Open this `**\emph**` example in Overleaf.](https://www.overleaf.com/docs?engine=pdflatex&snip_name=Using+the+emph+command&snip=%5Cdocumentclass%5B12pt%2C+letterpaper%2C+twoside%5D%7Barticle%7D%0A%5Ctitle%7BMy+first+LaTeX+document%7D%0A%5Cauthor%7BHubert+Farnsworth%5Cthanks%7BFunded+by+the+Overleaf+team.%7D%7D%0A%5Cdate%7BAugust+2022%7D%0A%5Cbegin%7Bdocument%7D%0A%5Cparindent0pt%25+To+remove+the+paragraph+indentation%0A%5Cmaketitle%0ASome+of+the+greatest+%5Cemph%7Bdiscoveries%7D+in+science+%0Awere+made+by+accident.%0A%0A%5Ctextit%7BSome+of+the+greatest+%5Cemph%7Bdiscoveries%7D+%0Ain+science+were+made+by+accident.%7D%0A%0A%5Ctextbf%7BSome+of+the+greatest+%5Cemph%7Bdiscoveries%7D+%0Ain+science+were+made+by+accident.%7D%0A%5Cend%7Bdocument%7D)

This example produces the following output:

![Image demonstrating use of the LaTeX \emph command](https://images.ctfassets.net/nrgyaltdicpt/1K0A8RXXOomakJBAr2usmp/62d0e8b5275092dd0b1b4a59c745b632/LL30Fig4r-plain.svg)

- **Note:** some packages, such as [Beamer](https://cn.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Beamer "Beamer"), change the behaviour of the `\emph` command.

## Adding images

In this section we will look at how to add images to a LaTeX document. Overleaf supports three ways to insert images:

1. Use the [**Insert Figure** button](https://learn.overleaf.com/learn/Kb/How_to_insert_figures_in_Overleaf#Using_Insert_Figure_to_add_a_figure_to_your_project)(![The Insert Figure button on the editor toolbar](https://sharelatex-wiki-cdn-671420.c.cdn77.org/learn-scripts/images/a/a8/InsertFigureButton.png)), located on the editor toolbar, to insert an image into **Visual Editor** or **Code Editor**.
2. [Copy and paste an image](https://cn.overleaf.com/learn/how-to/How_to_paste_formatted_content_into_Overleaf%23Pasting_images_into_your_Overleaf_project "How to paste formatted content into Overleaf") into **Visual Editor** or **Code Editor**.
3. Use **Code Editor** to write LaTeX code that inserts a graphic.

Options 1 and 2 automatically generate the LaTeX code required to insert images, but here we introduce option 3—note that you will need to [upload those images](https://docs.overleaf.com/writing-and-editing/inserting-images "Including images on Overleaf") to your Overleaf project. The following example demonstrates how to include a picture:

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{graphicx} %LaTeX package to import graphics
\graphicspath{{images/}} %configuring the graphicx package
 
\begin{document}
The universe is immense and it seems to be homogeneous, 
on a large scale, everywhere we look.

% The \includegraphics command is 
% provided (implemented) by the 
% graphicx package
\includegraphics{universe}  
 
There's a picture of a galaxy above.
\end{document}

 [Open this image example in Overleaf.](https://www.overleaf.com/project/new/template/25686?id=107971142&templateName=Example+using+images+in+LaTeX&latexEngine=pdflatex&texImage=texlive-full%3A2022.1&mainFile=)

This example produces the following output:

![Graphic showing an image imported into a LaTeX document](https://images.ctfassets.net/nrgyaltdicpt/4p5toat08FUgehv4yuNwXS/efc9e75e4342c9caeec94f26627fa337/LL30Fig5v2-plain.svg)

Importing graphics into a LaTeX document needs [an add-on _package_](https://cn.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Learn_LaTeX_in_30_minutes#Finding_and_using_LaTeX_packages) which provides the commands and features required to include external graphics files. The above example loads the [`graphicx` package](https://ctan.org/pkg/graphicx?lang=en) which, among many other commands, provides `\includegraphics{...}` to import graphics and `\graphicspath{...}` to advise LaTeX where the graphics are located.

To use the `graphicx` package, include the following line in your Overleaf document preamble:

\usepackage{graphicx}

In our example the command `\graphicspath{{images/}}` informs LaTeX that images are kept in a folder named `images`, which is contained in the current directory:

![Image showing LaTeX accessing images stored in a folder](https://sharelatex-wiki-cdn-671420.c.cdn77.org/learn-scripts/images/1/17/ImagesInAFolder.png)

The `\includegraphics{universe}` command does the actual work of inserting the image in the document. Here, `universe` is the name of the image file but without its extension.

**Note**:

- Although the full file name, including its extension, is allowed in the `\includegraphics` command, it’s considered best practice to omit the file extension because it will prompt LaTeX to search for all the supported formats.
- Generally, the graphic’s file name should not contain white spaces or multiple dots; it is also recommended to use lowercase letters for the file extension when uploading image files to Overleaf.

More information on LaTeX packages can be found at the end of this tutorial in the section [Finding and using LaTeX packages](https://cn.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Learn_LaTeX_in_30_minutes#Finding_and_using_LaTeX_packages).

## Captions, labels and references

Images can be captioned, labelled and referenced by means of the `figure` environment, as shown below:

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{graphicx}
\graphicspath{{images/}}
 
\begin{document}

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{mesh}
    \caption{A nice plot.}
    \label{fig:mesh1}
\end{figure}
 
As you can see in figure \ref{fig:mesh1}, the function grows near the origin. This example is on page \pageref{fig:mesh1}.

\end{document}

 [Open this image example in Overleaf.](https://www.overleaf.com/project/new/template/25519?id=107980830&templateName=Example+using+image+captions+in+LaTeX&latexEngine=pdflatex&texImage=texlive-full%3A2022.1&mainFile=)

This example produces the following output:

![Graphic showing use of figure captions in LaTeX](https://images.ctfassets.net/nrgyaltdicpt/4DkAWWkQqZP6QHU2EErogQ/9aa2371f2cde0f3f8bf22aa1c0b91789/LL30Fig6r-plain.svg)

There are several noteworthy commands in the example:

- **`\includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{mesh}`**: This form of `\includegraphics` instructs LaTeX to set the figure’s width to 75% of the text width—whose value is stored in the `\textwidth` command.

- **`\caption{A nice plot.}`**: As its name suggests, this command sets the figure caption which can be placed above or below the figure. If you create a list of figures this caption will be used in that list.

- **`\label{fig:mesh1}`**: To reference this image within your document you give it a label using the `\label` command. The label is used to generate a number for the image and, combined with the next command, will allow you to reference it.

- **`\ref{fig:mesh1}`**: This code will be substituted by the number corresponding to the referenced figure.

Images incorporated in a LaTeX document should be placed inside a `figure` environment, or similar, so that LaTeX can automatically position the image at a suitable location in your document.

Further guidance is contained in the following Overleaf help articles:

- [Positioning of Figures](https://cn.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Positioning_of_Figures "Positioning of Figures")
- [Inserting Images](https://docs.overleaf.com/writing-and-editing/inserting-images "Inserting Images")

## Creating lists in LaTeX

You can create different types of list using _environments_, which are used to encapsulate the LaTeX code required to implement a specific typesetting feature. An environment starts with `\begin{_environment-name_}` and ends with `\end{_environment-name_}` where `_environment-name_` might be `figure`, `tabular` or one of the list types: `itemize` for unordered lists or `enumerate` for ordered lists.

### Unordered lists

Unordered lists are produced by the `itemize` environment. Each list entry must be preceded by the `\item` command, as shown below:

\documentclass{article}
\begin{document}
\begin{itemize}
  \item The individual entries are indicated with a black dot, a so-called bullet.
  \item The text in the entries may be of any length.
\end{itemize}
\end{document}

 [Open this example in Overleaf.](https://www.overleaf.com/docs?engine=pdflatex&snip_name=Example+of+a+LaTeX+unordered+list&snip=%5Cdocumentclass%7Barticle%7D%0A%5Cbegin%7Bdocument%7D%0A%5Cbegin%7Bitemize%7D%0A++%5Citem+The+individual+entries+are+indicated+with+a+black+dot%2C+a+so-called+bullet.%0A++%5Citem+The+text+in+the+entries+may+be+of+any+length.%0A%5Cend%7Bitemize%7D%0A%5Cend%7Bdocument%7D)

This example produces the following output:

### Ordered lists

Ordered lists use the same syntax as unordered lists but are created using the `enumerate` environment:

\documentclass{article}
\begin{document}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item This is the first entry in our list.
  \item The list numbers increase with each entry we add.
\end{enumerate}
\end{document}

As with `unordered` lists, each entry must be preceded by the `\item` command which, here, automatically generates the numeric ordered-list label value, starting at 1.

## Adding math to LaTeX

One of the main advantages of LaTeX is the ease with which mathematical expressions can be written. LaTeX provides two writing modes for typesetting mathematics:

- _inline_ math mode used for writing formulas that are part of a paragraph
- _display_ math mode used to write expressions that are not part of a text or paragraph and are typeset on separate lines

### Inline math mode

Let’s see an example of inline math mode:

\documentclass[12pt, letterpaper]{article}
\begin{document}
In physics, the mass-energy equivalence is stated 
by the equation $E=mc^2$, discovered in 1905 by Albert Einstein.
\end{document}

 [Open this example in Overleaf.](https://www.overleaf.com/docs?engine=pdflatex&snip_name=Inline+LaTeX+maths+example&snip=%5Cdocumentclass%5B12pt%2C+letterpaper%5D%7Barticle%7D%0A%5Cbegin%7Bdocument%7D%0AIn+physics%2C+the+mass-energy+equivalence+is+stated+%0Aby+the+equation+%24E%3Dmc%5E2%24%2C+discovered+in+1905+by+Albert+Einstein.%0A%5Cend%7Bdocument%7D)

To typeset inline-mode math you can use one of these delimiter pairs: `\( ... \)`, `$ ... $` or `\begin{math} ... \end{math}`, as demonstrated in the following example:

\documentclass[12pt, letterpaper]{article}
\begin{document}
\begin{math}
E=mc^2
\end{math} is typeset in a paragraph using inline math mode---as is $E=mc^2$, and so too is \(E=mc^2\).
\end{document}

This example produces the following output:

### Display math mode

Equations typeset in display mode can be numbered or unnumbered, as in the following example:

\documentclass[12pt, letterpaper]{article}
\begin{document}
The mass-energy equivalence is described by the famous equation
\[ E=mc^2 \] discovered in 1905 by Albert Einstein. 

In natural units ($c = 1$), the formula expresses the identity
\begin{equation}
E=m

To typeset display-mode math you can use one of these delimiter pairs: `\[ ... \]`, `\begin{displaymath} ... \end{displaymath}` or `\begin{equation} ... \end{equation}`. Historically, typesetting display-mode math required use of `$$` characters delimiters, as in `$$ _... display math here ..._$$`, but this method [is no longer recommended](https://texfaq.org/FAQ-dolldoll): use LaTeX’s delimiters `\[ ... \]` instead.

### More complete examples

The following examples demonstrate a range of mathematical content typeset using LaTeX.

\documentclass{article}
\begin{document}
Subscripts in math mode are written as $a_b$ and superscripts are written as $a^b$. These can be combined and nested to write expressions such as

\[ T^{i_1 i_2 \dots i_p}_{j_1 j_2 \dots j_q} = T(x^{i_1},\dots,x^{i_p},e_{j_1},\dots,e_{j_q}) \]
 
We write integrals using $\int$ and fractions using $\frac{a}{b}$. Limits are placed on integrals using superscripts and subscripts:

\[ \int_0^1 \frac{dx}{e^x} =  \frac{e-1}{e} \]

Lower case Greek letters are written as $\omega$ $\delta$ etc. while upper case Greek letters are written as $\Omega$ $\Delta$.

Mathematical operators are prefixed with a backslash as $\sin(\beta)$, $\cos(\alpha)$, $\log(x)$ etc.

The next example uses the `equation*` environment which is provided by the `amsmath` package, so we need to add the following line to our document preamble:

\usepackage{amsmath}% For the equation* environment

For further information on using `amsmath` see [our help article](https://cn.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Aligning_equations "Aligning equations").

\section{First example}

The well-known Pythagorean theorem \(x^2 + y^2 = z^2\) was proved to be invalid for other exponents, meaning the next equation has no integer solutions for \(n>2\):

\[ x^n + y^n = z^n \]

\section{Second example}

This is a simple math expression \(\sqrt{x^2+1}\) inside text. 
And this is also the same: 
\begin{math}
\sqrt{x^2+1}
\end{math}
but by using another command.

This is a simple math expression without numbering
\[\sqrt{x^2+1}\] 
separated from text.

This is also the same:
\begin{displaymath}
\sqrt{x^2+1}

\ldots and this:

## Basic document structure

Next, we explore abstracts and how to partition a LaTeX document into different chapters, sections and paragraphs.

### Abstracts

Scientific articles usually provide an _abstract_ which is a brief overview/summary of their core topics, or arguments. The next example demonstrates typesetting an abstract using LaTeX’s `abstract` environment:

\documentclass{article}
\begin{document}
\begin{abstract}
This is a simple paragraph at the beginning of the 
document. A brief introduction about the main subject.
\end{abstract}
\end{document}

 [Open this example in Overleaf.](https://www.overleaf.com/docs?engine=pdflatex&snip_name=How+to+create+a+document+abstract&snip=%5Cdocumentclass%7Barticle%7D%0A%5Cbegin%7Bdocument%7D%0A%5Cbegin%7Babstract%7D%0AThis+is+a+simple+paragraph+at+the+beginning+of+the+%0Adocument.+A+brief+introduction+about+the+main+subject.%0A%5Cend%7Babstract%7D%0A%5Cend%7Bdocument%7D)

This example produces the following output:

![Image showing an abstract typeset in LaTeX](https://images.ctfassets.net/nrgyaltdicpt/4cPu8x8ZxuDVF6efcZ03yi/91aa6aa84719613b0e25c725b70aa0b8/LL30Fig14-plain.svg)

### Paragraphs and new lines

With the abstract in place, we can begin writing our first paragraph. The next example demonstrates:

- how a new paragraph is created by pressing the "enter" key twice, ending the current line and inserting a subsequent blank line;
- how to start a new line without starting a new paragraph by inserting a manual line break using the `\\` command, which is a double backslash; alternatively, use the `\newline` command.

The third paragraph in this example demonstrates use of the commands `\\` and `\newline`:

\documentclass{article}
\begin{document}

\begin{abstract}
This is a simple paragraph at the beginning of the 
document. A brief introduction about the main subject.
\end{abstract}

After our abstract we can begin the first paragraph, then press ``enter'' twice to start the second one.

This line will start a second paragraph.

I will start the third paragraph and then add \\ a manual line break which causes this text to start on a new line but remains part of the same paragraph. Alternatively, I can use the \verb|\newline|\newline command to start a new line, which is also part of the same paragraph.
\end{document}

This example produces the following output:

Note how LaTeX automatically indents paragraphs—except immediately after document headings such as section and subsection—[as we will see](https://cn.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Learn_LaTeX_in_30_minutes#Chapters_and_sections).

New users are advised that multiple `\\` or `\newline`s should not be used to “simulate” paragraphs with larger spacing between them because this can interfere with LaTeX’s typesetting algorithms. The recommended method is to continue using blank lines for creating new paragraphs, without any `\\`, and load the [`parskip` package](https://ctan.org/pkg/parskip?lang=en) by adding `\usepackage{parskip}` to the preamble.

Further information on paragraphs can be found in the following articles:

- [Paragraphs and new lines](https://cn.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Paragraphs_and_new_lines "Paragraphs and new lines")
- [How to change paragraph spacing in LaTeX](https://cn.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Articles/How_to_change_paragraph_spacing_in_LaTeX "Articles/How to change paragraph spacing in LaTeX")
- [LaTeX Error: There's no line here to end](https://cn.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Errors/LaTeX_Error%3A_There%27s_no_line_here_to_end "Errors/LaTeX Error: There's no line here to end") provides additional advice and guidance on using `\\`.

### Chapters and sections

Longer documents, irrespective of authoring software, are usually partitioned into parts, chapters, sections, subsections and so forth. LaTeX also provides document-structuring commands but the available commands, and their implementations (what they do), can depend on the document class being used. By way of example, documents created using the `book` class can be split into parts, chapters, sections, subsections and so forth but the `letter` class does not provide (support) any commands to do that.

This next example demonstrates commands used to structure a document based on the `book` class:

\documentclass{book}
\begin{document}

\chapter{First Chapter}

\section{Introduction}

This is the first section.

Lorem  ipsum  dolor  sit  amet,  consectetuer  adipiscing  
elit. Etiam  lobortisfacilisis sem.  Nullam nec mi et 
neque pharetra sollicitudin.  Praesent imperdietmi nec ante. 
Donec ullamcorper, felis non sodales...

\section{Second Section}

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit.  
Etiam lobortis facilisissem.  Nullam nec mi et neque pharetra 
sollicitudin.  Praesent imperdiet mi necante...

\subsection{First Subsection}
Praesent imperdietmi nec ante. Donec ullamcorper, felis non sodales...

\section*{Unnumbered Section}
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit.  
Etiam lobortis facilisissem...
\end{document}

This example produces the following output:

![Image showing sections in LaTeX book document](https://images.ctfassets.net/nrgyaltdicpt/1A1T7YsurQdM058OwmLqd8/7f6e962c31356bafa702bab9062f6061/LL30Fig16-plain.svg)

The names of sectioning commands are mostly self-explanatory; for example, `\chapter{First Chapter}` creates a new chapter titled `First Chapter`, `\section{Introduction}` produces a section titled `Introduction`, and so forth. Sections can be further divided into `\subsection{...}` and even `\subsubsection{...}`. The numbering of sections, subsections etc. is automatic but can be disabled by using the so-called _starred version_ of the appropriate command which has an asterisk (*) at the end, such as `\section*{...}` and `\subsection*{...}`.

_Collectively_, LaTeX document classes provide the following sectioning commands, with specific classes each supporting a relevant subset:

- `\part{part}`
- `\chapter{chapter}`
- `\section{section}`
- `\subsection{subsection}`
- `\subsubsection{subsubsection}`
- `\paragraph{paragraph}`
- `\subparagraph{subparagraph}`

In particular, the `\part` and `\chapter` commands are only available in the `report` and `book` document classes.

Visit the Overleaf article [article about sections and chapters](https://cn.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Sections_and_chapters "Sections and chapters") for further information about document-structure commands.

## Creating tables

Overleaf provides three options to create tables:

1. Using the [**Insert Table** button](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/how-to/How_to_insert_tables_in_Overleaf%23inserttable#Using_Insert_Table_to_create_a_table_in_your_project) in the **Visual Editor** (or **Code Editor**) toolbar.
2. [Copying and pasting a table](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/how-to/How_to_paste_formatted_content_into_Overleaf%23pastingtables) from another document while using **Visual Editor**.
3. Writing the LaTeX code for the table in Code Editor.

If you’re new to LaTeX, using the toolbar in **Visual Editor** (option 1) is a great way to get started—you can switch between **Visual Editor** and **Code Editor** to see the code behind the table.

Here, we focus on option 3—the most flexible method for creating tables—and provide examples that demonstrate how to create tables in LaTeX, including the addition of lines (rules) and captions. As you gain experience, take a look at our detailed guidance on [how to create tables using LaTeX](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Tables).

### Creating a basic table in LaTeX

We start with an example showing how to typeset a basic table:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c c c}
 cell1 & cell2 & cell3 \\ 
 cell4 & cell5 & cell6 \\  
 cell7 & cell8 & cell9    
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

 [Open this example in Overleaf.](https://www.overleaf.com/docs?engine=pdflatex&snip_name=An+example+of+a+basic+table&snip=%5Cdocumentclass%7Barticle%7D%0A%5Cbegin%7Bdocument%7D%0A%5Cbegin%7Bcenter%7D%0A%5Cbegin%7Btabular%7D%7Bc+c+c%7D%0A+cell1+%26+cell2+%26+cell3+%5C%5C+%0A+cell4+%26+cell5+%26+cell6+%5C%5C++%0A+cell7+%26+cell8+%26+cell9++++%0A%5Cend%7Btabular%7D%0A%5Cend%7Bcenter%7D%0A%5Cend%7Bdocument%7D%0A%3C%2Fsource%3E)

This example produces the following output:

![Graphic displaying a table typeset in LaTeX](https://images.ctfassets.net/nrgyaltdicpt/5K46QavbKv9vF4RI1GbUf2/f22d4f8a06d00251166f86d2c891321e/LL30Fig17-plain.svg)

The `tabular` environment is the default LaTeX method to create tables. You must specify a parameter to this environment, in this case `{c c c}` which advises LaTeX that there will be three columns and the text inside each one must be centred. You can also use `r` to right-align the text and `l` to left-align it. The alignment symbol `&` is used to demarcate individual table cells within a table row. To end a table row use the _new line_ command `\\`. Our table is contained within a `center` environment to make it centred within the text width of the page.

### Adding borders

The `tabular` environment supports horizontal and vertical lines (rules) as part of the table:

- to add horizontal rules, above and below rows, use the `\hline` command
- to add vertical rules, between columns, use the vertical line parameter `|`

In this example the argument is `{|c|c|c|}` which declares three (centred) columns each separated by a vertical line (rule); in addition, we use `\hline` to place a horizontal rule above the first row and below the final row:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} 
 \hline
 cell1 & cell2 & cell3 \\ 
 cell4 & cell5 & cell6 \\ 
 cell7 & cell8 & cell9 \\ 
 \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

### Captions, labels and references

You can caption and reference tables in much the same way as images. The only difference is that instead of the **`figure`** environment, you use the **`table`** environment.

Table \ref{table:data} shows how to add a table caption and reference a table.
\begin{table}[h!]

\begin{tabular}{||c c c c||} 
 \hline

## Adding a Table of Contents

Creating a table of contents is straightforward because the command `\tableofcontents` does almost all the work for you:

\documentclass{article}
\title{Sections and Chapters}
\author{Gubert Farnsworth}
\date{August 2022}
\begin{document}
  
\maketitle
  
\tableofcontents

\section{Introduction}
   
This is the first section.
      
Lorem  ipsum  dolor  sit  amet,  consectetuer  adipiscing  
elit.   Etiam  lobortisfacilisis sem.  Nullam nec mi et 
neque pharetra sollicitudin.  Praesent imperdietmi nec ante. 
Donec ullamcorper, felis non sodales...
       
\section*{Unnumbered Section}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Unnumbered Section}

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit.  
Etiam lobortis facilisissem.  Nullam nec mi et neque pharetra 
sollicitudin.  Praesent imperdiet mi necante...

\section{Second Section}
       
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit.  
Etiam lobortis facilisissem.  Nullam nec mi et neque pharetra 
sollicitudin.  Praesent imperdiet mi necante...

Sections, subsections and chapters are automatically included in the table of contents. To manually add entries, such as an unnumbered section, use the command `\addcontentsline` as shown in the example.
